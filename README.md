# Sonic Robo Blast 2 BDM-Edit
basically a "fork" of srb2 that basically adds merge/pull requests that seems good enough to add.
# Compiling
also you cant use cmake to compile, im sorry
> if your using MINGW32 to compile this, IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
* instead, uninstall and reinstall MSYS2, and open up MINGW64 and you MUST install the required dependencies, Otherwise it will not work!

```pacman -S git make mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc```
# Changes & Pull/Merge requests i added
* Removed APNG support since it was useless
* Port Namechanges From srb2classic (!2687 from SRB2 gitlab)
* Add menu for custom console variables (!2407 on SRB2 gitlab)
* Fixed all incompatible inpointer types

* Removed 32 bit support

and theres alot more i have to list but im not gonna bother doing the rest.
